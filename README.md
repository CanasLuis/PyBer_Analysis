# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: We have 2 data bases with very useful information, one of them has the detail of cities, type of city and drivers per each city, the other one contains the detail of the fares, ride id, and cities, as well as the dates in which the ride ocurred. When we merge the 2 databases together, we can have a complete data base with detail of types of citys and how much are the fares in each one of them. Additionaly, we can obtain a lot of descriptions of the differences in the rates and number of drivers in each city, and its direct relation with the number of rides. 
We are working for an expert in data bases so we have to be very careful and do a great work in order to show our capabilities, we will be using scatter charts, and dataframes to show the summary for every type of city. 

## Results
During our first analysis, we saw that the urban cities are the one with the more amount of rides per day, as it was expected since those cities use to have more people living there. In addition, the average distance should be larger that in a rural or smaller city. However, we also indentified that the rates in urban cities are the lowest, whilst the more expensive rates were seen in rural cities. That means that in rural cities we have to pay more for every ride than in an urban city. 
The information above says that the main reason of having lower rates in urban cities is due to the competittion between the drivers, in rural cities we have a lower amount of drivers and also the demand for a trip is lower, so the drivers there have to increase their own rates. Below we can see a summary of the information in each one of the types of city:


Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
