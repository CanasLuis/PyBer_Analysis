# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: We have 2 data bases with very useful information, one of them has the detail of cities, type of city and drivers per each city, the other one contains the detail of the fares, ride id, and cities, as well as the dates in which the ride ocurred. When we merge the 2 databases together, we can have a complete data base with detail of types of citys and how much are the fares in each one of them. Additionaly, we can obtain a lot of descriptions of the differences in the rates and number of drivers in each city, and its direct relation with the number of rides. 
We are working for an expert in data bases so we have to be very careful and do a great work in order to show our capabilities, we will be using scatter charts, and dataframes to show the summary for every type of city. 

## Results
During our first analysis, we saw that the urban cities are the one with the more amount of rides per day, as it was expected since those cities use to have more people living there. In addition, the average distance should be larger that in a rural or smaller city. However, we also indentified that the rates in urban cities are the lowest, whilst the more expensive rates were seen in rural cities. That means that in rural cities we have to pay more for every ride than in an urban city. 
The information above says that the main reason of having lower rates in urban cities is due to the competittion between the drivers, in rural cities we have a lower amount of drivers and also the demand for a trip is lower, so the drivers there have to increase their own rates. Below we can see a summary of the information in each one of the types of city:

The next analysis was focused on the types of city, having the drivers, fares and rides in each type of city, where we clearly see the relation between number or riders with fares and drivers, which means, in the urban type of cities we have the bigger drivers amount (2,405) with 1,625 riders. in the other hand, the average fare per Ride and per driver are bigger in rural city types:

##Summary
My recomendations to the business would be:
-Maintain the more drivers amount in the Urban cities, even if the average fare is the smaller, the total earning amount at the end will be the bigger since a lot of trips occur in those cities.

-Rural cities are also important for the bussiness because with few amount of trips the fare is good and its not neccesary to have a lot of drivers there.

-Suburban type is right in the middle of the bussiness, less demand of trips than Urban but also a medium income compared to rural. So all the 3 types of cities contribute to the bussiness, I would keep the track on the results in the further years to ensure that the behaviour remains the same in the 3 different types, I mean, we donÂ´t want a city with very few trips and an average fare very low too.
